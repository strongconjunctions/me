  	<p><strong class="highlight">I am a frontend developer</strong>. Having worked on both sides of the design spectrum (as a print designer, digital designer, and a frontend developer) I strongly believe in the UI/UX co-dependency. This means that my design process is geared towards a specific client, and a specific goal that the client is pursuing. My objective here is to make sure that the client is able to reach that goal faster and with less time and resource expenditures. Design for me is first and foremost about <strong>functionality</strong> at every stage of the process: at the level of performance, code readability, ease of access, and visual clarity (which in itself is an important function for the user). I therefore view myself as someone heavily invested in such design features as <strong>organization</strong>, <strong>planning</strong>, and <strong>clear taxonomy</strong>. Design for me is also an effective form of information distribution, which is why I tend to view any highly organized and efficient system as a perfectly designed and beautiful system. I also strongly believe that web development today is at the forefront of exploring the UI/UX relation, as well as discovering new forms of human interaction.
